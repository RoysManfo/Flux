# What are we going to do here
This brach will be used to rebuild completely the whole application, make it easier to mantain and  
allow faster implementation of new features and a complete change of the language from italian to english.

In addition, all hard coded outputs directlty from the Cristal (like login messages) will be handled by a dedicated
file, to make language translations much easier

The new app will contain many more features, and will make start contributing much easier.

## Things to change
*__More changes will be added...__*
 - [ ] Change the login system
 - [ ] Take the text output form a dedicated file in a fixed location
 - [ ] Change the usage of os.chdir() to have something more like how other terminals handle the current position on disk

# List of all available `cr` commands
This is a list of all available cr commands.  
*In each command the cr part before the command name has been omitted, except for the `cr` command, which doesn't need it.* 

You can also check the [docs](./docs/README.md) for more detailed information

Commands with a `!` in front are commands still in development

Command | Description
